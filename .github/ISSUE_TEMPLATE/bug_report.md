This is an issue template, meant to help expedite the process of creating and resolving issues. Please fill out the various sections below (feel free to remove placeholder text before submitting). If you are overwhelmed by this, or confused, you can remove it all and just write whatever you want, but be aware that I might not respond as quickly if you do that.

**Troubleshooting**
Before creating your issue, please run through the following troubleshooting steps to make sure this is not a temporary glitch or caused by a factor outside the control of this tool:

- [ ] If you have recently installed any new browser extensions, try temporarily disabling them to see if that fixes mine (sometimes extensions interfere with each other)
- [ ] Verify that LinkedIn has not rate-limited or banned your account. If you cannot load profiles, or get random error messages and blank pages, that is outside my control

**Describe the issue**
What has gone wrong? Or, how is the tool not acting how you are expecting it to?

**Help me reproduce your issue**
In order to expedite a bug fix, please help me narrow down what could be causing your issue by providing details that will let me replicate the same issue you saw:

- Where did this happen?
	- Was this on a standard LinkedIn profile page? Did the URL start with `https://www.linkedin.com/in/`?
- Is there anything special about the profile you were trying to extract?
	- Example of something *"special"*: Multi-lingual profiles
- How consistent is this issue?
	- Does this happen 100% of the time, on every profile? On a specific profile? Just some of the time?

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
